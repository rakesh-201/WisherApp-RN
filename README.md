## Description

As the name suggests, this is an app which wishes people whom you wanna wish on their special day like birthday, anniversary or any other day.

What you have to do is to add the person's special day's ( say birthday's ) date along with a short message and save it in this app, rest all is managed by us.

This app will send you a notification on that saved day at 12 (mid-night) and upon clicking on that notification you will be directed to a page where you will be asked to confirm the sending of the message, and upon doing that the message will be send to the respective person.

This is one of our best apps and we are constantly working on it.

Hope you'll enjoy using it.
